GOST 31446-2017 is a specific standard that covers the technical requirements for casing and tubing used in oil and gas wells.\n3. Terminology: API uses American English terminology, while GOST uses Russian terminology.\n4. Technical requirements: The technical requirements specified by API and GOST for casing and tubing differ in some ways. For example, API specifies different grades of steel for casing and tubing, while GOST specifies a single grade of steel for both. Additionally, API and GOST have different requirements for dimensions, tolerances, and mechanical properties.\n5. Testing and inspection: API and GOST have different requirements for testing and inspection of casing and tubing.

Certification: API requires that manufacturers of casing and tubing hold a valid API Monogram License, which involves regular audits and inspections to ensure compliance with API standards. GOST does not have a similar certification program.\n7. International recognition: API standards are widely recognized and used internationally, while GOST is primarily used in Russia and some other countries that were part of the former Soviet Union. This means that companies that operate internationally may choose to follow API standards for greater consistency and ease of use across their operations.\n8. Updates and revisions: API frequently updates and revises its standards in response to new technologies, industry developments, and changing regulations. GOST standards are less frequently updated and revised, which can make it more challenging to ensure compliance with current best practices and standards.\n9. Language: As mentioned earlier, API uses American English terminology, while GOST uses Russian terminology.
